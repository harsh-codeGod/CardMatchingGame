# CardMatchingGame
Eight cards are displayed on the screen and the user's task is to match all the cards to end the game as soon as possible with the least mismatches.

There are three different scenes. The first one is the welcome scene, the second one is the game and the third scene shows the score.
The welcome scene basically has three buttons: "start", "how to play" and "exit" and each button shows an alert upon being clicked and each alert has an action associated with it.
The start button brings you to the game view scene, "how to play" button instructs the user how to play the game and the exit button basically exists the game.

The scene where rhe game runs the cards are displayed on the screen and there's a stopwatch on the top of the screen which tracks how long it takes for the user to play the game.

Upon finishing the game an alert is displayed and after "Ok" is clicked in the alert it brings up the scoreboard (the next scene).

The scoreboard basically displays the number of mismatches and how long it took for the user to match all the cards.
